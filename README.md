<h1 align='center'>Engineering: How It All Comes Together</h1>
<p>Driven by a deep fascination with how technology can transform healthcare, I'm actively shaping my path as a medical software student. My journey began at Ankara University, where I master the art of Biomedical Engineering. Simultaneously, I'm a sponge for Software Engineering knowledge, seeking it from every source imaginable. I'm committed to merging these disciplines to create impactful solutions that improve lives.</p>

I'd love to share my portfolio with you. I think you'd enjoy interacting with it: https://augusta-dev.github.io/portfolio/
